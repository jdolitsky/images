Base image with just enough files to run static binaries!

This image is meant to be used as a base image only, and is otherwise useless. It contains the `alpine-baselayout-data` package from Alpine, which is just a set of data files needed to support glibc and musl static binaries at runtime.

This image can be used with `ko build`, `docker`, etc, but is only suitable for running static binaries.

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/musl-dynamic:latest
```
# Usage

See the [examples/](./examples/) directory for
an example C program and associated Dockerfile
that can be used with this image.
