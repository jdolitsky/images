# Checklist

* Image is marked experimental or stable as appropriate
* The last two minor versions are available
* The latest tag points to the newest stable version
* There is a dev tag available that includes a shell and apk tools
* The image runs as `nonroot `and GID/UID are set to 65532
    * Alternatively the username and GID/UID may be a commonly used one from the ecosystem e.g: postgres
    * See above for exceptions to nonroot rule
* ENTRYPOINT 
    * For applications/servers/utilities call main program with no arguments e.g. [redis-server]
    * For base images leave empty
    * For dev variants set to entrypoint script that falls back to system
* CMD:
    * For server applications give arguments to start in daemon mode (may be empty)
    * For utilities/tooling bring up help e.g. `â€“help`
    * For base images with a shell, call it e.g. [/bin/sh]
* Consider where and how the image deviates from popular alternatives. Is there a good reason and is it documented?
* Add annotations e.g:

        annotations:
          "org.opencontainers.image.authors": "Chainguard Team https://www.chainguard.dev/"
          "org.opencontainers.image.url": https://edu.chainguard.dev/chainguard/chainguard-images/reference/busybox/ #use the academy site here
          "org.opencontainers.image.source": https://github.com/chainguard-images/images/tree/main/images/bazel #use github here

* Check if environment variables are needed e.g. to set data locations
* Ensure the image responds to SIGTERM
    *  `docker kill $(docker run -d --rm cgr.dev/chainguard/nginx)`
* Documentation. Let's make this excellent. Include usage example.
* Error logs write to stderr and normal logs to stdout. DO NOT write to file.
* Include tests, at the very least a basic smoke test.
